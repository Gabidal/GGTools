ggui (0.1.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Input events now use IVector2 instead of Coordinate struct
  * Many if not all classes are now written in lower camelCase
  * Vector2 is now correctly named FVector2 for containing floating point coordinates
  * GGUI::mouse is now an IVector2 type
  * You can now give percentage floating point values for almost any value based styling, like width or color channel and so on...
  * GGUI does no longer have RGBA, instead opacity is given as a single floating value per element node
  * RGB lerp can use Gamma color correct compute for much higher cost or use cheap simple lerp formula
  * Since most of the node structure is now given as an HTML/XML like, GGUI provides `on_init()` and other `on()` state change function handlers the user can customize
  * `GGUI::Main` is not accessible anymore, since it was moved under `GGUI::INTERNAL::Main`, and intended for user to access through `GGUI::getRoot()`
  * Titles are now native to element class so window class was removed
  * Pixel based canvas has been removed, since only terminal cell based canvas is needed
  * Button class has been removed, since normal textField with `on_click()` brings out the same behavior
  * SwitchBoxes have now `singleSelect(true)` like styling which disables all other marked switchBoxes in the same parent, giving user simple way to make single select choice lists
  * Shadow styling has been removed, to be replaced later on with full shaders like customizations
  * Fixed where transparency wasn't propagated properly to transparent layers of text, not obtaining color from layers below
  * To prevent unnecessary string concatenations GGUI implements its own string_view and string concatenation, these are called:
  * Since GGUI has a varying and sometimes deeply nested functions of getters, many of them have been made constexpr to hopefully ease inlining and runtime
  * To prevent weird std::vector behavior and total control in niche use case of it, GGUI now implements its own fastVector for more cache-like behavior between render passes
  * Added proper scripts for linux and windows side for init, build, export, test and benchmarking with various kinds of tools
  * GGUI can take now -DGGUI_DEBUG, -DGGUI_RELEASE or -DGGUI_PROFILE, which are automatically managed via the meson build system, but could be manually set for fine control

ggui (0.1.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Updated `Build_Body.cpp` to automatically compile as a single header file.
  * Update `meson.build` to include AVX support for SIMD.
  * Overhauled thread scheduler systems for improved task management.
  * Optimized hitbox updater, job scheduler, and buffer encoder.
  * Streamlined shadow and opacity processing.
  * Improved UTF symbol initialization, transitioning from strings to `Compact_String`.
  * Enhanced styling system by replacing `unordered_maps` with class member access.
  * Changed RGBA alpha channel from float to unsigned char, optimizing to fit within a 32-bit register.
  * Secondary threads now avoid spin-locking when paused.
  * Dedicated a separate thread for the rendering pipeline, preventing conflicts with the main thread.
  * Refactored sleep functions and fixed lambda capture issues.
  * Addressed missing default arguments.
  * Removed OUTBOX from development listings and refined styling merging.
  * Updated constructors to set element names from strings.
  * Rewrote the `Text_Field` and `Progress_Bar` classes.
  * Enhanced `List_View` to re-adjust contents upon resizing.
  * Ensured GGUI compiles without warnings
  * Resolved issues with Unix-side key inputs and mouse support.
  * Improved RGBA alpha channel handling and memory management.
  * Addressed bugs in key handling and system stability.
